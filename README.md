## PluginLoader   
This project only works on win32 platform.   
   
Simplify the work needed to create and load dynamic libraries in C++.   
This project was forked from class_loader and its primary goal is to remove its depenendencies (Boost, console_bridge, Poco).   
    
In addition, added test cases in class_loader differently from facontidavide/PluginLoader.
